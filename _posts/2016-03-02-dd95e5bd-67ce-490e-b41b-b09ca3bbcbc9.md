Light is a language! I like to explore
the use of longer exposures to create desired dramatic or subtle effects in
water, sky or atmospheric perspective. To achieve the drama within the shot, I may use various neutral density filters and/or graduated filters to control the way light resists time. I prefer to shoot when the light and conditions are at their
best. The golden hour. The results are a great reward or frustration depending on what's thrown at you, weather and time, the land or my endurance... HDR is OK too when the bear is at your ankles. ;)
