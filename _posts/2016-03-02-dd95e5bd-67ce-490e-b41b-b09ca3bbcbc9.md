I like to explore
the use of long exposures to create desired dramatic or subtle effects in
water, sky or atmospheric perspective. To achieve the drama within the shot, I
use various neutral density filters and/or graduated filters to control the
play of light. I prefer to shoot when the light and conditions are at their
best. This results in great reward or frustration depending on what's thrown at
me for light, weather and time.
