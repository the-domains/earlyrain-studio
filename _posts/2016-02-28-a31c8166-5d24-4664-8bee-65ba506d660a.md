Hi! I'm Chris!  If you would
have told me twenty years ago that I was going to be an artist and a landscape photographer
as my day job, I would have looked at you sideways. I am a self-taught
painter and image engineer -- a closet painter for over 30 years and taking
photographs for over 40... I can't believe that it's been that long. My passion
for both has grown one day at a time. Every moment that I spend in the field sketching,
painting or shooting, I consider a blessing. The pace of daily life fades to
black and the Lord's amazing creation takes center stage. I focus on creating
images that have photographic authenticity... Photos that evoke a sense of wonder
and paintings that make you want to step into the canvas. I have my beautiful
wife Naomi that supports my efforts to be the best I can be in my work and in
my life. I have my wonderful children that I am thankful proud of... and I have
my Lord with whom I walk every day. What more do I need?
